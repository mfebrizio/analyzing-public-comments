USDA-2017-0002-0307,"Agency needs to change the intra-agency process for reviewing a Timber Harvest Plans is complex, lengthy and costly, resulting in inconsistency and inequity. litigation by activists is the primary issue of achieving goals of health forest outcomes. Appropriate forest management  can result in trees being removed from the forest and  the timber and wood can generate income for forest management to fight wildfires.  Efforts to maximize demand for removed wood, funding should be shifted from reacting to the consequences of poor forest management to preventative treatments that promote forest health and resilience. raise public awareness of forest health issues. collaborate with state colleges and universities to  offer more forestry programs to increase awareness of forest health concerns in their communities , to educate the public. Water districts can play a greater role in  educating their customers on the wildfires and pollutions of water. levels and attitudes toward forest health should be measured at the onset of educational campaigns, and policymakers should set clear goals for the changes they would like to see in those attributes. changing the culture surrounding fire and finding the right balance in wood processing infrastructure. We must hold the agencies accountable to its forest management goals against wildfires. With enough space, sunlight, nutrients and water, trees have the capacity to grow and thrive. They become stressed when lacking these elements. 
Century-old policy of putting out all fires, known as fire suppression, has created overcrowded forests. Before European settlement, naturally-ignited fires and those lit by Native Americans cleared the forest of debris that could cause severe fires. These events and practices also checked the growth of new trees that would compete with older, bigger trees. was a very diverse landscape of open, closed, young, and old forests.This diversity is essential to forest resiliency and helps forests survive a variety of threats. Wildfire has an especially negative impact on these critical watersheds. Soil erosion, particularly following a fire severely degraded water quality. watershed looks like a milkshake, and treating it costs millions of dollars.
Small towns, the local rural areas that lack strong economies, lucrative tax bases and  on concentrated political power that are bearing the economic brunt of tree mortality crisis. Their lives, property and infrastructure are threatened by dead and dying trees and the consequences of massive wildfires.
accumulated underbrush allows fire to overcome those defenses and burn hotter and climb into the tree canopy. Crown fires that burn at and move along tree-tops are the hardest to suppress due to an unlimited supply of fuel. Crown fire behavior is unpredictable, and kills most of the trees in its path. Water is negatively impact to downstream users,  soils into hardpan, blocking their natural function of capturing water and replenishing aquifers at lower elevations
Overgrown forests release less water for these needs. A Nature Conservancy report found that thinning forests to make them healthier could increase downstream water yields by up to 6 percent. The loss of diverse habitat under current management practices includes the loss of valuable meadows. Meadows absorb and hold water and release it. Overgrown forests also trap more of the annual snowpack in their higher branches, causing it to evaporate rather than reach the ground and flow downhill to water storage facilities later in the year when its most needed.

USDA-2017-0002-0439,"Conditions of Concern Regarding (PART 1)
Current Malheur National Forest Management Practices
February 18, 2018
The following conditions of concern and questions regarding management practices on the Malheur National Forest are 
brought forward here to hopefully shine a light on certain inconsistent or inappropriate practices in policy and in field 
operations. These practices show signs which appear to be beneficial to some operators to the detriment of other operators
 and to the local community.
These questionable practices will be listed knowing that there are overlapping and inter-tonguing areas where practices affect
 multiple types of operations and harvest objectives. 
As a result of number 13 below we have volunteered to write down their concerns  and present them widely so that changes 
may be made in these processes outlined below that will improve practices and give some equity to the timber industry in our 
area of the Malheur National Forest. 
Stewardship Programs (SP), Stewardship Grants (SG) and Timber Sales
1.	Stewardship revenues go to the General Fund and not to the local communities. A Recent stewardship program in 
Harney County harvested around 200 MM board feet of timber with No revenues going to the County. 
2.	There is no revenue sharing on biomass. A recent SP paid the contractor for the thinning of biomass and then the 
contractor owned the biomass to sell at a time of his choosing. 
3.	There is no stumpage charge for merchantable trees in the recent SP's. The contractor essentially is getting paid twice 
for the work he is doing. 
4.	A recent large SP paid the contractor by equipment hour vs by loads or board feet of production. This system is a virtual
 invitation for billing abuse and is difficult if not impossible to audit. 
5.	SP sizes and time limitations are such that a small operator is at an extreme disadvantage or simply unable to bid on 
these. Timber sales can do the same kinds of things as SP's but can be let out on a smaller scale, so more small operators 
will have a chance to successfully bid on them. In addition, the revenues from timber sales return back to the local county. 
6.	The practice of letting SG's and contracts based on ""best value"" vs cost to the public, lends itself to highly subjective 
and often blatant cronyism or nepotism. The quality of the work can be controlled by proper oversight and sale requirements. 
Opening these contracts up to multiple operators both makes the costs more competitive and builds a larger contractor base 
and industry. 
7.	The letting of large, longer term SG's to single larger contractors essentially gives them a monopoly on the mill.  The mill 
will be dictated to by the large contractor so the smaller contractor may or may not ever see a mill contract for the duration of 
the large SP. 
8.	Recent SP's have allowed the contractor to mark his own trees which again leads to the perception, if not reality, of 
abuse by the contractor. Again here, timber sales are marked by the agency and thus there is opportunity for oversight and 
audits of the harvest.
9.	It has been stated that SP's do not have to be advertised in the local media but only via the internet. Timber sales must 
be advertised in the local paper and other available media. Both SP's and timber sales should be advertised the same in 
order for all to have fair notification. 
10.	On some SG's and Timber sales the contractor is allowed to trade service work for timber. The agency then turns 
around and writes a 1099 for the entire stumpage and the contractor also gets a 1099 from the logs hauled to the mill. 
This is double taxation.
11.	On a timber sale the agency marks the sale with no quality control on the marking team.  Often there are trees marked 
with no stump shots. Missing one stump shot per 100 trees creates a huge potential liability for the contractor over the entire 
sale. 
12.	In some cases, non-merchantable (crooked, split or forked) trees are marked on the stump the same a good tree? 
13.	Maybe the most troubling of all this is that the industry has been weakened to the point where the remaining small 
loggers are afraid of reprisals against them if they raise complaints about unfair or negligent practices exercised by the 
regulating agency. Without the ability to trust that their concerns will be fairly treated they have, or perceive to have, no 
way to stand up for their valid rights as contractors!

Chemical accident leaked benzene, into a tributary of the Huangpu River . Country's most industrial regions are some of the driest, with 45 per cent of the country's gross domestic product produced in water-scarce provinces such as Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi.

Many of the conclusions are incomplete, inaccurate, lack objectivity and consequently only serve to confuse the issue. Government initiate as a matter of priority thorough, should ban china imports, t engage across industry and community of real science , and include an advisory process representing the range of interests and concerns.

China has passed United States in 2011 as the largest global GHG emitter and China, India, do not ascribe to international GHG reduction agreements. The emission of the nitrogen dioxide pollutant has gone up significantly in the South Asia region, Chhattisgarh region of India, largest increases occurred over Jamnagar (India), Dhaka (Bangladesh) had the largest increase (79 per cent) of any world city. Pollution in China's waterways remains 'grave, many of waterway tested in nearly 200 rivers was not safe to use. Dongying, near the mouth of the Yellow River, an aviary (bottom) sits silent and empty. The ecology of this regiona critical refueling stop for migratory birds along the East Asia-Australasia flywayhas been damaged . 

CHINA; Shanghai only three percent of the water in the city's rivers and lakes was sufficient quality to be used as water resources for residents. The poor quality of the rest of Shanghais water resources is mainly due to discharges by local Shanghai. The Nature Conservancy in 2016 stated that 73 percent of the water catchment areas that supply surface water, which we depend on for daily consumption, to Shanghai and 29 other major Chinese cities were affected by medium to high pollution levels.

19 of the World's 20 most polluted cities are in Asia, and every year 2 millions of deaths are attributed to pollution.
Issue On October 30, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated a rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas data from large greenhouse gas emissions sources in the United States.

EPA reliance on IPCC but the air pollution monitoring were only available in one quarter of the population in China and only a few percent of the population in India, and in both countries, PM2.5 monitoring networks have only been created very recently, so long-term trends cannot be assessed. Indias pollution levels have kept creeping upwards, making 2015 the worst year on record. Out of Indias 89 cities only 17 are covered by the continuous air quality monitoring system, Durgapur, Gorakhpur, Asansol, Shiliguri, Bareilly and Ludhiana are among the most polluted cities .

USDA-2017-0002-0193,"America needs to stop Wind Farms and Solar and subsides,    Real life example;    Dec 2017 Australian Minister Josh Frydenberg  release the Menzies Research Centre report, which calls for subsidies for renewable energy to be phased out and gas-extraction bans to be lifted to prevent prices rising higher.  Renewable energy subsidies push up bills, says report  Subsidies for renewable energy are behind most power price increases, adding almost $300 to the average electricity bill, according to a report that calls for a ""reboot"" of the national energy market. Our energy markets are broken. The nation is now facing the prospect of shortages and widespread blackouts, a scenario that until recently was unimaginable to most Australians.
Australian and renewables subsides ,   ""Consumers and business owners have a right to feel angry,"" Mr Shepherd said. ""They have been largely kept in the dark about the extent and effect of subsidies to support the introduction of renewable energy,    consumers had borne the cost of ""ill-judged"" state and federal renewable energy programs, which had resulted in a less-efficient, less-reliable national electricity supply.  
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found in October that consumer electricity prices had risen by 63 per cent on top of inflation since 2007-08, prompting chairman Rod Sims to warn that households were under ""unacceptable pressure"".  Australian households and businesses now suffer from high energy prices and diminished reliability. A decade ago, prices were the fifth-lowest in the OECD. Today they are the 12th highest. The current situation is failing the nation. The retirement of caseload generators and the scarcity of gas has created uncertainty in supply  the cost of energy has increased (residential prices have increased by 63 per cent on top of inflation since 2007-08), and investor confidence has been severely diminished. Renewable energy policies have increased costs without a corresponding increase in transparency.   Renewable energy policies are failing to deliver which is costing families and businesses for no apparent advantage.  
The result was a deficit of dispatchable energy and a significant increase in prices. Energy prices are reducing Australia's competitiveness. For instance, between 2007-08 and 2014-15, the cost of electricity to increase output by $100 increased from $5.77 to $9.28 for primary metal and metal product manufacturing, from $1.68 to $3.34 for food product manufacturing, and from $0.92 to $1.62 for agriculture.  
The estimated subsidies paid under the LRET and SRES components of the RET have increased from about $100 million in 2003-04 (in current value) to $2.74 billion last financial year. Had consumers been more aware of this being added to their power bills, they are unlikely to have agreed to them. All subsidies distort the market.
At least four Australian inquiries have found that it is possible to manage community concerns relating to environmental and social issues with respect to gas exploration and production, the most practical method of which is a cost-benefit analysis on a project-by-project basis.
Menzies Research Centre report, chaired by former Business Council of Australia head Tony Shepherd, also recommends the federal government revive community discussions on nuclear energy, and scrap state-based renewable energy targets in favor of a national framework. The report saves its most scathing comments for the role state and federal governments played in the lead-up to South Australia's statewide blackout last year. ""Failures in the energy market that led to the first statewide blackout for more than half a century were entirely caused by ill-judged state, territory and federal government policies,"" He said consumers and businesses were not warned about the technical challenge of trying to integrate large amounts of non-synchronous energy generation into the grid. ""Nor were they told about the high cost of sourcing reliable energy when wind and solar generators are idle,"" he added. Mr Shepherd said.
The combined policies of state and federal governments regarding energy infrastructure, generation and distribution have in the past two decades degenerated into one of the biggest policy failures in postwar Australia.

USDA-2017-0002-0309,"June 2017,   Congress sent letter to Department of the Treasury   stating  U.S.  and  European officials, and U.S. intelligence community have all publicly noted that Russia and its government corporations are funding a covert anti fracking campaign to suppress the widespread adoption of fracking in Europe and the U.S.- all in an effort to safeguard the influence of the Russian oil and gas sector.   For example, former NATO Secretary-General  Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters in 2014, ""I have met allies who  can report that Russia ... engaged actively with so-called non-governmental  organizations ... to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas.""   Russia's attempts to maintain a stronghold on the European oil and gas market is well documented,  
Feb. 2018   ; reported .  The Russian ship known as The Gaselys a Russian natural gas (LNG) ship,  which arrived in Boston Harbor on Sunday Jan 28,  will be offload gas for use in New England. A second tanker named Provalys expected at  U.S. middle of Feb. 15, See  web site as  www.kpler.com    Lpler is a global ship tracking company. This is nuts, and crazy, who is running the energy dept ?? .... Why is New England blocking pipelines from the Marcellus, domestically produced gas that is cheaper, if they need Home heating gas ; why not AMERICAN GAS ???? outrageous,  Several news outlets reported.  Buy America, support taxpayers and budget to help poor.  Why send money overseas. ??  this is harming America small business.
Now back to June 2017   The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is conducting oversight of what appears to be a concerted efforts by foreign entities to funnel millions of dollars through various non-profit entities to influence the U.S. energy market.  According to the former Secretary General of NATO, ""Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called nongovernmental organizations- environmental organizations working against shale gas- to maintain dependence on imported Russian gas.""Other officials have indicated the same scheme is unfolding in the U.S.  These statements and related reply is providing evidence that Russia is also behind the radical statements and vitriol directed at the U.S. fossil fuel sector.  The purpose of this letter is to request that the U.S. Department of Treasury investigate these and related allegations.
... Russia  has been using a mix of hard and soft power in its attempt  to recreate  a sphere  of influence,  including  through  a campaign  of disinformation  on many issues, including energy.  In general, the potential for Russia using energy supplies as a means of putting pressure on European nations is a matter of concern.  No country should use supply and pricing as tools of coercion.
Hillary Clinton, with access to intelligence reports, made a private speech in 2014, We [the State Department and the U.S.] were up against Russia pushing oligarchs and others to buy media.  We were even up against phony environmental groups, and I'm a big environmentalist, but these were funded by the Russians to stand against any effort, 'Oh that pipeline, that fracking, that whatever will be a problem for you,' and a lot of the money supporting that message was coming from Russia.""
Recent news reports reference a ""U.S. intelligence community's [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] report on Russian activities in the presidential election"" that contains ""clear evidence that the Kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the United States. According to media outlets, the report found that "" [Russian Today News] ran 'anti-fracking programming, highlighting environmental issues and the impacts on public health,' which is 'likely reflective of the Russian government's concern about the impact of fracking and the U.S. natural gas production on the global energy market and the potential challenges to Gazprom's profitability. It is easy to see the benefit to Russia and Gazprom that would result from a reduction in the U.S. level of drilling and fracking- a position advocated for by numerous environmental groups in the U.S have infiltrated U.S. organizations at home and attempted to sway public opinion and thereby government opinion.

April in 2018 was the coldest month in the past 21 years

Would it surprise you to learn the greatest global two-year cooling event of the last century just occurred? From February 2016 to February 2018 (the latest month available) global average temperatures dropped 0.56C. You have to go back to 1982-84 for the next biggest two-year drop, 0.47Calso during the global warming era. But Cooling outliers garner no media attention. 
The global average temperature numbers come out monthly. If they show a new hottest year on record, thats a big story. If they show a big increase over the previous month, or the same month in the previous year, thats a story. If they represent a sequence of warming months or years, thats a story. When they show cooling of any sortand there have been more cooling months than warming months since anthropogenic warming begantheres no story.

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it had placed on the United States could have cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.

China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years13. 

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

China was allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. American was not allowed, but China Could, 

 India was allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Even Europe was allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

If the Paris Agreement had been implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degreethink of that; this muchCelsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100. In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America  in the year 2030.

The Paris Accords Green Fund could have obligated the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billionAnd nobody even knows where the money went. 

 In 2015, the Green Climate Funds executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020. 

The risks of the Paris Accord grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time. In other words, the Paris framework is a starting pointas bad as it isnot an end point.  
Exiting the agreement protected the United States from future intrusions on the United States sovereignty and massive future legal liability,  we would have massive legal liability if we stay in.

In essence, permitting data connected to USDA food distribution programs to be used as derivatives keeps scores of people jobless that are otherwise ready and willing to work.

Regarding a cost/benefit analysis, the elimination of the use of USDA data for derivative purposes would eliminate the financial incentives other sectors -- both involved in the public, the private, and the public-private realms -- have in refusing to include appropriate wage and benefit rates in the considerations of the cost/benefit analyses they perform.

USDA-2017-0002-0204,"Protect the Farms and crops by Cutting old growth and thinning trees before fires.  The immensity of greenhouse gas emissions from California wildfires has been a warning for years. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex of old trees, dead bushes, etc, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. If managed wisely, and remove the environmental activists that has stop forest personal from cutting old growth.  America's national forests can provide clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and abundant domestic supplies of wood products and support rural communities and thousands of jobs in the timber industry. Clearly, we must make every effort to reduce the amount of excess biomass in forests to prevent catastrophic wildfires. That means decreasing the number of trees by thinning to make them more resistant to crown fires, which will also restore the natural health and diversity of our forests. Reducing the number and severity of wildfires may be the single most important action we can take in the short-term to lower greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. The catastrophic wildfires that ravage California each year don't resemble the historic fires that took place in these forests for millennia.  Just too many over grown bushes and trees. They exceed emissions that would have occurred in historic fires because the biomass available to burn is so much greater than it was in natural forests. Consequently wildfires, when the massive amounts of fuel in these forests burned, they released an estimated 9.5 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere just from combustion. That is an average of about 63 tons per acre. However, combustion is only part of the story because dead trees also gradually release CO2 as they decay. CO2 emissions from decay are generally three times greater than emissions from combustion because large quantities of wood and other plant material remain unburned after a forest fire.   Combining combustion and decay emissions.  Estimates that fires will emit a staggering 38 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Fires released one fourth of the gases during combustion, and post-fire decay will release the remainder during the next 100 years, most of it during the next 50 years. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. California should be required to limit wildfire NOx emissions to reduce ozone, and to limit annual NOx and SO2 emissions to reduce fine particle pollution.  Mercury emissions from forest fires (QHg) (in kg of mercury per year) can be estimated following a bottom-up approach by the equation: contribute substantial emissions of gases and particles to the atmosphere. 
Over the years, outside the regulatory process, well-funded special interest groups have use  lawsuits to force federal agencies  to issue regulations that advance their priorities. At some point, this exercise of ""Sue-and-Settle"" and the practice of acquiescence through consent decrees or settlement agreements, which were often crafted behind closed doors and without the transparency of the rulemaking process, became all too common, paying tens of thousands of dollars in attorney's fees to these groups with which were settled. More transparent process in which impacted parties and states have a voice and creates more awareness for the general public is needed. Policies and rules should reflect common sense, consistent with statutory authorities so the public will benefit from greater un-regulatory providing economic certainty not the Environment activist .
REFORM The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) . Revise Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  GREATER use of Regulatory Flexibility Act to assess rules effects on small businesses.  BETTER USE OF REINS Act expedited congressional vote on all major or significant rules before they are effective.   REFORM National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).   Wildfires need to be included in EPA issued rules in 2012 and early 2016 to control emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to address safety . These emissions can impact air quality and even climate. Daily emissions of particulate matter and numerous trace gases from wildfires mercury emissions from major natural sources and their variations with meteorological conditions is considered one of the major priority in estimating the relative contribution of major natural sources compared to industrial sources and ultimately to evaluate the mercury flux released to the atmosphere on regional and global scale. estimate the contribution of wildfires to the total mercury released to the atmosphere.  An accurate estimate of carbon fluxes associated with California wildfire over the last two decades is needed to balance the global carbon budget not oil and gas or coal, or factories.

NEPA is potentially a statute not very well integrated, inconsistent, and non- flexible, and not entirely clear on some points of law which seem to need clarified by interpretation, That it has made a significant difference in the hurt caused to the poor in rural United States and possible influenced by governments abroad is hardly debatable. NEPA was possible inspiration, put over on an unsuspecting Congress and  the public by an environmental lobby groups. Its purpose was the writing of impact statements; and this action-forcing procedure has been a great inducement to ecological rationality in Federal actions of activists, which ignored consequences of rural America.  Agencies need a  technical fix or administrative reorganization to  achieve the NEPA intent.  To implement NEPA as intended requires a president like we have today, committed to its objectives and using his appointive, budgetary and leadership powers to this end.  It should not require a judiciary to recognizes the legislative history and substantive intent of the statute  which defeats the purpose of successive Congresses through narrow legalistic  interpretations. Regulations should  be developed after consultation with affected States and local governments.

This misguided NEPA is an economic assault on small businesses, timber harvest,  rural America,  manufacturing and agriculture, farming, ranching, and natural resource development, and threatens the very livelihood of our fellow states. Small businesses and rural America are the backbone of this country, especially in rural America.

In addition to ash and smoke, fires release carbon monoxide into the atmosphere. Carbon monoxide is a pollutant that can persist in the atmosphere for about a month and can be transported great distances.  New images made with data acquired by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on NASAs Aqua satellite show the high concentrations of carbon monoxide emitted from the fires (in orange/red) between July 29 and August 8. As the time series progresses, carbon monoxide high in the atmosphere is shown drifting east -- with one branch moving southward toward Texas and the other forking to the northeast.  From space, AIRS measures carbon monoxide high up in the atmosphere -- where it has little effect on the air we breathe. However, strong winds can carry this pollutant downward to where it can have significant effects on air quality.

Despite semi-formal central review of economic, environmental, and health and safety regulations and their accompanying paperwork since the late 1970s and the 1980s, a significant and escalating regulatory burden is apparent: 1 costs of regulation and realms subject to regulation have grown, while benefits remain ambiguous; 2 entire sectors of society experience regulation from independent agencies that get little scrutiny; 3 Federal Register page counts occupy record heights; 4 economically significant and major rules reviewed annually have increased notably over the past decade; 5 regulatory dark matter outside the normal notice and comment procedure lacks adequate scrutiny. It is no longer enough just to cut federal spending and balance the budget. The need to offset the march of bureaucracy and regulation and proposed ideas for doing that, even though the current reality assures us that the Constitution is not coming to the rescue in the near term. There is much about which to be optimistic; the ideas that created the American experiment in the first place remain ""discovered"", available in the public domain. Given today's economy, there should be bipartisan momentum for economic and regulatory reform, some animated new constituency for LIMITED GOVERNMENT. The regulatory process, therefore, itself needs more regulation. The executive and legislative branches may not agree on congressional reassertion of its authority with respect to making of law and regulation. While it would be preferable that Congress engage by implementing the Regulatory Improvement Act, the REINS Act, and other measures that directly LIMIT AGENCY AUTHORITY, those face the signing by this pro American  presidency.  Many recommendations can be implemented by executive action, by the same pen and phone now used to expand the state. If  an expensive or burdensome regulation is enacted, elected representatives are on record for or against, and accountable to voters. The federal regulatory enterprise increasingly AFFECTS MANY BUSINESS AND TAX PAYERS,  and changes are likely one way or another. With conventional options to restore liberties and elevate the rule of law exhausted or ignored, the states themselves may address the federal government's expansion by taking rightful powers back from Congress and the executive branch. The Constitution's Article V does provide for the states to call a convention to amend the Constitution and restore balance of power, and several states are pursuing that option (Brown, 2014). With respect to over-regulation possible a new , REGULATION FREEDOM AMENDMENT that would empower President  to force agencies to propose said amendment. The amendment would stipulate that, in any given major rule, require House and the Senate  to vote on a significant federal regulation, very much like the REINS Act legislation would do (Buhler, 2013).. The NEW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  primary task SHOULD be to double GDP, rather than to double spending or regulatory burdens, no matter the political party."

USDA-2017-0002-0398,"One Meteorologist  in 2008 said ;  , Politicians have come to see global warming as a way to raise revenue by rationing CO2 production with schemes such as the 'cap and trade' legislation now in Congress. The taxes assessed for producing CO2 could be huge. But global warming as proclaimed by Al Gore and Co. was  a hoax, Scientist Williams said that ""there are 'strong and powerful counter-arguments' to the theories on global warming and carbon trading that are not being fully considered."" ""There is no proof that carbon dioxide is causing or precedes global warming,"" Williams wrote on August 15, 2008. ""All indications are that the minor warming cycle finished in 2001 and that Arctic ice melting is related to cyclical orbit-tilt-axis changes in earth's angle to the sun,""  the  risks associated with natural and man-made catastrophes, weather and climate, rejected the notion that there is a ""consensus"" on global warming.  The fact was that the 'biotic' agents (man and other living organisms) had a very small role compared to the 'abiotic' (geological, geomorphologic, climatologic, planetary and hydrological) events like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, movement of glaciers and landslides.   In reality, rarely is there ever a last and final word in studies of complex systems such as earth's environment. Rather, science is a dynamic process based on the scientific method in which researchers test hypotheses leading to new discoveries, but also reexamine earlier theories and try to improve, build upon, or extend them.   Environmental Sciences at Australia's James Cook University, in 2008. ""As the climate change debate moves from the scientific to the political, it is important to stay with the facts. The bottom line is that humans cannot prevent global warming. Therefore, we should not be forced into emissions trading schemes, or any other scheme that sacrifices Australia's economic advantage and standard of living for the wrong reasons,"" Collins wrote on August 13, 2008. we should not be carried away by misconceptions about what is driving climate change. It's with the Earth itself . Another scientist,  McElmurry wrote on August 7, 2008. ""Packs of rats wait in that [rat] hole to reap trillions coming down it to fill advocates pockets. As a Meteorologist I find it scientifically Dishonest!"" the claims of the effects are fantastically blown out of   believable proportion, money we are about to spend on drastically reducing carbon dioxide will line the pockets of the environmentalists who have such expertise readily available at the right price. And some politicians are standing in line to fill their pockets with kick back money for large grants to the environmental experts, for the purpose of developing new ways to drastically reduce the emissions. In case you haven't noticed, it is an expanding profit-making industry, growing in proportion to the horror warnings by government officials and former vice-presidents. Many questions remain to be answered regarding the real significance of anthropogenic carbon dioxide as a climate forcing factor and related rising sea level consequences projected by the [UN] IPCC,"" Bell, who is internationally for his contributions to the design of space habitats and systems, including the International Space Station, wrote on June 18, 2008. ""First, there is no incontrovertible evidence to support contentions that pre-industrial carbon dioxide levels were consistently lower than the 380 ppm recorded now. More than 90,000 published measurements carried out between 1812 and 1961 indicate that atmospheric levels were actually rising before the Industrial Revolution. They reached about 440 ppm in 1820, dropped to about 390 ppm by 1855, and rose back to about 440 ppm by 1940,"" Bell explained. ""Cause and effect relationships between atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from all sources and global temperatures are inconclusive.  ""The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that about 97 percent of that small amount originates from natural sources, andfurther, that all atmospheric carbon dioxide may account for less than 10 percent of total greenhouse influence.  There is urgent need to put the phenomenon, which had not been triggered off suddenly, in the right perspective as today almost every human activity right from vehicular emissions to use of polythene is being linked to global warming which was a much larger event which started as soon as the Ice Age ended. The fact was that the 'biotic' agents (man and other living organisms) had a very small role compared to the 'abiotic' (geological, geomorphologic, climatologic, planetary and hydrological) events like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, movement of glaciers and landslides.  The atmosphere has periodic warming and cooling cycles. The sun is the primary source of energy impacting the earth's surface. That energy heats the land and the seas, which then warm the air above them. "

But few plans have been implemented to protect their species   Laguna de Guayatayoc is home to large populations of different varieties of flamingos, including James's flamingos, Andean flamingos and Chilean flamingos. The Andean flamingo is considered a vulnerable species due to the mining business disturbances causing changes in its habitat. primary threat to the flamingo population is mining. A study on Salinas Lake in Peru showed that mining companies have established themselves adjacent to the flamingos' nesting sites, and some mining is performed near flamingo breeding grounds and feeding sites. exploration resulted in a decreased success rate for breeding. The decreased reproductive success may be due to an altered environment caused by bulldozers disturbing the lake bed. Mining creates a muddy environment, which entraps flamingos, thus increasing mortality. Residents near the mining activities report sightings of dead flamingos exhumed by the bulldozers. The extraction process also affects the water availability.  Andean flamingos filter surface water for food, but borax mining pollutes this water. Along with the pollution, the extractions expedite the removal of lake moisture. flamingos' offspring numbers diminished by mining activities. The Flamingo Specialist Group, established in 1971, is actively trying to inform the public on the vulnerability of flamingos. the International Union for Conservation of Nature to create an action plan for the flamingos. Auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of High Andean Flamingos and their Habitats was concluded and came into effect on 4 December 2008. The MoU covers Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. As of August 2012, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru have signed the MoU. The MoU aims to improve the conservation status of the species and their habitats through coordinated and concerted actions across the range. In late 2011, the Legal Aid Network (REDAJ) presented to the Public Defenders Office a survey titled ""Preliminary Report on the Violation of Rights and the Socio-environmental Conflicts Related to Mining.

According to estimates by the American Bird Conservancy, Even though many of these birds are protected by laws such as the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act, in a congress 2015 report, Bureaucrats in Obama Administration routinely applied laws differently, often giving a pass to their allies while vigorously prosecuting businesses and individuals who do not share their far-left political ideals. A prime example of this can be found in the clearly differential treatment towards the protection of animals.  In those years renewable energy companies had enjoyed preferential treatment, including the ability to avoid compliance with laws as well as generous tax breaks, government loans, and subsidies unavailable to oil and gas companies, despite the inherent risk and financial loss repeatedly presented. 
A congress report outlined, while administration agencies In September 2014,  were actively blocking oil and natural gas development claiming to be protecting endangered species, it developed a plan intended to ""create a framework to streamline renewable energy permitting...on more than 22 million acres"" of public and private land in the California desert full of endangered animals.  The 8,000 page plan, which encompassed nearly one-quarter of the state, had been in the works for five years under President Obama to avoid ""typically long, complicated environmental reviews,"" which are in place because of these environmentalists themselves. There serves perhaps no greater example of preferential treatment Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project near the California and Nevada border. In addition to the clear cronyism displayed on this project, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project serves as a textbook example of how far this Administration is willing to bend over backwards for its friends at the expense of others. Owners were granted federal money to build the Ivanpah project in an area that ""served as prime desert tortoise habitat,"" which resulted in tortoise casualties. The tortoises, which are federally listed as threatened, are not the only casualties of Ivanpah as project biologists reported the killing of 76 birds in the final three months of last year alone. In addition, the Ivanpah project had been labeled a risk to air safety due to an unsafe glare coming from the thousands of billboard-sized mirrors ""nearly blinding"" pilots.   As if killing animals, endangering the lives of aircraft passengers, and perpetuating the revolving door of cronyism with this project was not enough, Ivanpah owners successfully got the agency to delay the repayment of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loans only to astonishingly apply for a $539 million grant from the U.S. Treasury to pay off their debt to agency.  These are just fraction of  efforts by past Administration to play favorites, picking their far-left environmentalist friends as winners while attacking hydraulic fracturing and subsequently the oil and gas industries all at the expense of the American people.
Wind turbines are over two times as tall as the skyboxes at a Stadium and taller than the Statue of Liberty. And the blades on windmills can be as long as a football field and their blinking lights can be seen for twenty miles.
Solar panels pose major risks to firefighters who are struggling to finds ways to safely put out blazes caused by the alternative energy source. For example, in 2013 it took more than 300 firefighters over 72 hours to put out an 11-alarm fire at a massive distribution center in South New Jersey, which ultimately destroyed the entire building. The roof of the almost 300,000 square foot facility was lined with more than 7,000 solar panels. One of the major concerns for firefighters is the risk of electrocution from solar panels because most cannot be turned off, leaving the wiring hot and dangerous. These dangers have forced firefighters to extinguish fires from a distance and focus merely on containing solar panel fires rather than trying to save the actual building.
Solar panels and wind turbines cannot be made without fossil fuels. A wind turbine is comprised of primarily steel (89.1%) and fiberglass (5.8%). Steel is made from iron ore through a process using coal or natural gas, and fiberglass is made from petroleum-based chemicals. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) listed as a disadvantage of wind power, ""The consumption of fossil fuels and water during construction and decommissioning can be significant."" 
Solar panels rely on photovoltaic cells to capture sunlight that are composed of rare metals. These metals are acquired through mining, and at least one of the primary metals is made ""from ash derived from burning coal for the production of energy.""

USDA-2017-0002-4102,"On behalf of the Family Farm Alliance (Alliance), thank you for this opportunity to submit formal comments regarding regulatory reform at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Alliance is a grassroots organization of family farmers, ranchers, irrigation districts, and allied industries in 16 Western states.  The Alliance is focused on one mission: To ensure the availability of reliable, affordable irrigation water supplies to Western farmers and ranchers. We are also committed to the fundamental proposition that Western irrigated agriculture must be preserved and protected for a host of economic, sociological, environmental, and national security reasons  many of which are often overlooked in the context of other national policy decisions.  

There are critical issues that the Western family farmers and ranchers we represent are confronted with at this time.  At the top of the list is the daunting number of administrative policy initiatives that are facing Western agricultural producers. These types of federal water resources actions and regulatory practices could potentially undermine the economic foundations of rural communities in the arid West by making farming and ranching increasingly difficult.  American family farmers and ranchers for generations have grown food and fiber for the world, and we will have to muster even more innovation to meet this critical challenge. That innovation must be encouraged rather than stifled with new federal regulations and uncertainty over water supplies for irrigated farms and ranches in the rural West. 

Background

On February 24, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order (E.O.) 13777Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda, which established a federal policy to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens on the American people. The E.O. directs federal agencies to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force (Task Force). One of the duties of the Task Force is to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the USDA Secretary regarding their repeal, replacement, or modification. The E.O. further calls on the Task Force to seek input and other assistance, as permitted by law, from entities significantly affected by Federal regulations, including State, local, and tribal governments, small businesses, consumers, non-governmental organizations, and trade associations on regulations that meet some or all of the criteria above. 

Overview of Family Farm Alliance Recommendations

We appreciate that USDA has extended the public comment period to help its Task Force's evaluation of existing regulations. Our recommendations (detailed further in the attached PDF) are aimed at Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the two USDA agencies our members closely interact with. They are grouped into five categories:

	Principles, Requirements and Guidelines (PR&G) and Related Agency-Specific Procedures for federal investments in    Water Resources (USDA Departmental Regulation DR 9500-013); 
	National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Processes Associated with Forest Health (regulations at 36 CFR part 220, Forest Service Manual 1950, and Forest Service Handbook 1909.15); 
	NEPA Processes Associated with New Water Development Projects (7 CFR PART 1b); 
	2015 Clean Water Rule  Waters of the U.S. (80 FR 37054, June 29, 2015)
	NRCS Water Conservation Programs (7 CFR Chapter VI)

In the attached document, we attempt to be as specific as we can, and wherever possible, provide a Federal Register (FR) or Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) citation when referencing a regulation or directive. We have identified areas where regulations should be repealed, replaced or modified. Wherever possible, we note if jobs will be eliminated or job creation inhibited by certain regulations. We seek to explain how some of these regulations and policies are outdated, unnecessary or ineffective, or impose costs that exceed benefits. 

Western irrigated agriculture is a strategic and irreplaceable national resource. It must be protected by the federal government in the 21st Century. Recognizing the value of Western irrigated agriculture is vital. Properly managing federal watersheds and encouraging federal agencies to work with the agricultural community to solve local water challenges are imperative. 

Thank you for this opportunity to provide input on this matter, which is very important to the family farmers and ranchers of our membership. We are hopeful that a concerted good-faith effort to address the issues discussed above will result in streamlined regulatory processes that will be efficient, fair and effective.   We look forward to working with you toward that goal.

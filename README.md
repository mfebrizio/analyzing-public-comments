# Background
Under a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the [George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center (RSC)](https://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/) conducted research analyzing public comments to inform agency regulatory reform efforts in the United States. A group of faculty members and researchers affiliated with the GW Regulatory Studies Center contributed to the report, and subject matter experts at the USDA Office of the Chief Economist provided technical advice. The research report is available at: https://regulatorystudies.columbian.gwu.edu/putting-food-table-agriculture-and-regulation

In this research, we (the RSC research team) developed Python code to retrieve, clean, and analyze data of public comments. We share the code in this reporsitory. The goal is to provide code that can be easily modified for use in other research using public comments.
